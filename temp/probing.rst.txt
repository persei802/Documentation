PROBING
=======
The probe screen has been through basic testing but there could still be some minor bugs. 
When running probing routines, use extreme caution until you are familiar with how everything works. 
Probe routines run without blocking the main GUI. This gives the operator the opportunity to watch the DROs and stop the routine at any time.

.. note:: Probing is very unforgiving to mistakes; be sure to check settings before using.

There are 2 probe interfaces available - VersaProbe and BasicProbe. 
The only keywords accepted are “versaprobe” and “basicprobe” (no quote marks). 
Any other, or none at all, will start the GUI with no probing page.
The user can specify which one to use in the INI file. For example:

.. code-block:: python

  [PROBE]
  USE_PROBE = versaprobe
  
.. image:: images/versaprobe.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Probe page showing VersaProbe

.. code-block:: python

  [PROBE]
  USE_PROBE = basicprobe

.. image:: images/basicprobe.png
  :width: 800
  :alt: Probe page showing BasicProbe
