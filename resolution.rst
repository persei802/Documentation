SCREEN RESOLUTION
=================
QtDragon was initially developed for a screen with 1440 x 900 resolution and was not resizable. 
It will work in window mode on any monitor with higher resolution but not on monitors with lower resolution.
There is also an HD version with 1920 x 1080 resolution available on Github at https://github.com/persei802/QtDragon_hd
